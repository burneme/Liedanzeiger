Many of the old fashioned displays in churches face problems when searching for spare parts i.e. bulbs and resting switches. I found a very nifty way to do a replacement using "https://github.com/mrazekv/church-numbers",
where a system with HDMI-Monitor and raspberry-Pi zero 2W is shown as a solution.
The invest is very small, currently used 24"-Monitors (in most cases this size is more than enough) are cheap, a "raspberry pi zero 2W" is less than 20€ and the input can be done with any browser on tablet/mobile-phone/notebook.

The minium you need is:

  **Full HD-Monitor** with HDMI input,
  
  **raspberry pi zero W** or **raspberry pi zero W** including **µSD-card 8GB minimum**,
  
  **tablet / mobile phone / PC / notebook**,
  
  **HDMI cable** and a **USB-power supply**.
  
The code for the µSD card "ready to start" you can't get from this site. It was my first intention to provide the final image, however they are too large to upload. Instead you might use the link from mrazekv including all the steps to get a rocksolid installation (read-only file system) or I can provived a physical µSD for the net cost price, currently below 5€. Github doesn't allow large files, even my available cloud cannot handle files beyond 1GB.
If there is the requirement for one or more additional displays (side aisles), a Sat(telite) version is possible. In cases, when the second monitor is not far away, a HDMI-splitter can be used to connect two monitors to one single raspberry. In my home town this unit with satellite is now running for a year with good experience.

Finally it looks like this:

Neat arrangement of connection cables.
The specific python/html-code, which is more or less a translation from czech language will follow soon. This should be installed in the home directory of user admin.
