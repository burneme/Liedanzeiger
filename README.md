Many of the old fashioned displays in churches face problems when searching for spare parts i.e. bulbs and switches. So, I found a very nifty way to do a replacement using "https://github.com/mrazekv/church-numbers",
where a system with HDMI-Monitor and  raspberry-Pi zero W is shown as a solution.
The invest is very small, currently used 24"-Monitors are cheap, a "raspberry pi zero 2W" is less than 20€ and the input can be done with any browser on tablet/mobile-phone/notebook.

The minium you need is:

  **Full HD-Monitor** with HDMI input,
  
  **raspberry pi zero W** or **raspberry pi zero W** including **µSD-card 8GB minimum**,
  
  **tablet / mobile phone / PC / notebook**,
  
  **HDMI cable** and a **USB-power supply**.
  
The code for the µSD card you can get here. 
Finally it looks like this:
